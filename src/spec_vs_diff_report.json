  "summary": "Diff adds a Motoko backend stub actor and a React/Tailwind portfolio SPA scaffold (App renders a new Portfolio component), plus Internet Identity + React Query plumbing. Several BuildRequest items are not evidenced (Framer Motion usage, correct TypeAnimation usage, resume.pdf static serving/link, and complete dfx deployment instructions). Some extra auth/query infrastructure was added that was not requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Portfolio UI must match the exact structure and content of the user-provided `Portfolio` component (sections Home/About/Skills/Projects/Resume/Contact) including the same text, links, and anchors, without changing profile content.",
      "reason": "The diff shows a newly created `Portfolio.tsx`, but the provided diff is truncated and does not include the full component (including Projects/Resume/Contact content and exact links). Therefore it is not possible to verify that the structure/content/links exactly match the user-provided component.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/Portfolio.tsx (truncated)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Add and configure required frontend dependencies for Framer Motion animations, TypeAnimation typing effect, and Lucide icons; ensure the build compiles successfully.",
      "reason": "Lucide icons are imported, but there is no evidence of Framer Motion usage in the component. Also `TypeAnimation` is referenced but no import is shown in the file excerpt, and the summary file claims a 'native React typing effect component without external animation libraries', which conflicts with the requirement to use the TypeAnimation dependency. Build success cannot be verified from the diff summary.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Serve `resume.pdf` as a static asset accessible at `/resume.pdf` and ensure the Resume section has a working download link to `/resume.pdf`.",
      "reason": "No `resume.pdf` file addition is shown, and the `Portfolio.tsx` excerpt is truncated before the Resume section content/link is visible. Thus accessibility at `/resume.pdf` and the presence/behavior of the download link cannot be confirmed.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/Portfolio.tsx (truncated)"

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Provide minimal README deployment instructions for the standard `dfx` workflow to deploy canisters and serve the SPA from a frontend canister URL.",
      "reason": "A `frontend/README.md` is added, but the content shown is truncated mid-setup and does not evidence the required minimal `dfx` commands/steps or confirmation of a canister URL workflow.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/README.md (truncated in diff summary)"

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added Internet Identity provider wiring and actor/query infrastructure (React Query + authenticated/anonymous actor creation), despite the portfolio being specified as static and not requiring auth or backend interaction.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest does not ask for authentication UX, actor hooks, or query infrastructure—only that no third-party auth be added and II is allowed (not required). The diff adds `InternetIdentityProvider` usage in `main.tsx` and `useActor` logic using React Query.",

    {
      "description": "Custom CSS keyframe animation utility classes used for animations instead of the requested Framer Motion-based animations.",
      "reason": "REQ-2 specifically requests Framer Motion animations; the diff shows extensive CSS keyframes/utilities and component class usage like `animate-fade-in-up`, with no evidence of Framer Motion usage.",
